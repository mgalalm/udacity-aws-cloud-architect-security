# Identify tools that will allow you to do:
## Scan infrastructure as code template
### [CloudSploit](https://cloudsploit.com/)
#### Example vulnerability
Identify things like publicly accessible s3 buckets or weak password policies.
### [SkyArk](https://github.com/cyberark/SkyArk) 
#### Example vulnerability
SkyArk deals with Cloud Shadow Admins - how malicious actors can find “limited” permissions to elevate their privileges and become full cloud admins.  
### [Terrascan](https://runterrascan.io/)
#### Example vulnerability
Identify out of compliance and security issues
### [CloudRail](https://cloudrail.com/)
#### Example vulnerability
Supports dynamic analysis, by looking, for example, at the security group being used even with only reference in the template, by cross-checking it with what’s already in the cloud.  
## Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
### JFrog Xray 
#### Example vulnerability
This commercial tool does a recursive scanning for all underlying layers and dependencies, even those archived.
### AWS ECR 
#### Example vulnerability
Beside its core functionality as image registry, AWS ECR scan images on push for vulnerabilities, depending on Clair project CVEs database. 

### Clair
#### Example vulnerability
Privilege escalation

## Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
### [AWS Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/): 
#### Example vulnerability
If the agent installed in the instance, it can check vulnerabilities at OS level, for example CIS benchmarks for both Linux and windows 
### AWS config
AWS Config pull together configuration snapshots of a host of  core infrastructure services that AWS provides. When it is activated, it provides insight not only in how a particular resource is configured, but also on the changes of configuration over time.
#### Example vulnerability
An example is deticting a misconfiguration of  security group that allows RDP access from all IP addresses - or 0.0.0.0/0 port 3389.
