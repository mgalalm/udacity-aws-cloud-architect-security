Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

### Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 Security group is overlay permissive 

Disable access to port 22, by removing the rule of  0.0.0.0/0  of port 22, even better removing all other rules keeping only access to port 5000 and the source of security group of LB. 


### Instance [i-03af029e50945baed](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:instanceId=i-03af029e50945baed) is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible

Disable password authentication in the instance, from ssh config file    

### S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
Enable  server-side encryption on S3 bucket, notably secret bucket
